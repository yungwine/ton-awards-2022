TON AWARDS 2022
===============
    
Hey Devs! 
    
In 2022, the peerless TON community of developers made a lot of open source non-commercial projects: development tools, apps and services, and so on.

Honestly, you are so productive that we don't even know about all the developments.

We wanted to bring all such developments together and reward useful non-commercial projects.
    
This event comes in addition to our [grant programs](https://ton.org/grants), which focus on a different type of project.
